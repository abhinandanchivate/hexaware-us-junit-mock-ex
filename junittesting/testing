Mockito : it is the most widely used mocking framework in java.
it helps us to create the test doubles (mock, stub, spies) to isolate
the class under test and verify its behavior, without needing 
real depedencies (like db, apis, or services).

why use Mockito?
1. avoids depedency on external systems(DB, network, services etc)
2. makes unit test faster , repeatable  and reliable.
3. lets you verify interactions(e.g. whether a method ws called 
with correct arguments).
4. help us with TDD(Test driven development).
